1. we can get all the state of redux store as props. For this we need to make 
a function name mapStateToProps and the param is state and we will return as object
there are a key and value is the state value. And we will access the state in 
component by using props. we will make the function at the bottom of component
function.
    ===>
        const Shop = props => {
            console.log(props.carts);
        }

        const mapStateToProps = state => {
            return {
                carts:state.carts,
            }
        }

2. And for dispatching any action or perform any action we need to make a object
named mapDispatchToProps there we will give action method name as key name and
value will be the action method. And we will receive the method from props and after
than we will use it.
    ===>
        const Shop = props => {
            return {
                <button onClick={()=>props.addToCart(1)}>add to cart</button>
            }
        }

2. After that we will call the connect method on a variable. And the first arg is
the mapStateToProps function as callback function. And the 2nd arg is mapDispatchToProps
object.
    ===>
        const connectToStore = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps);

2. After that we will call this connectToStore variable as method on a variable.
And give the component as argument. For doing this our component will connected
to the redux store. After that will will export default this connected component.
    ===>
        const connectedToStore = connectToStore(Shop);
        export default connectedToStore;

3. We can do same thing in one line:
    ===>
        export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Shop);
