1. we need to import {} createStore function / method from 'redux' for creating 
redux store. we will create this store under store folder of redux folder. we 
will give the reducer as arg of createStore function / method. and We will call
the createStore method on a variable. 
    ===>
        import {createStore} from 'redux';
        const store = createStore(cartReducer);
        export default store;

2. After that we need to connect redux with react. For this we need to import 
Provider component from 'react-redux' on main parent component. In root.render method 
we will render/use Provider component with store props. In store props we will
put out store that we create.
    ===>
        import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
        import {store} from './redux/store/store.js';
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
        root.render(
            <Provider store={store}>
            <App />
            </Provider>
        );
