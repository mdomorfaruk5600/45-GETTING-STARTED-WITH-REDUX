1. reducer function / method must have state default param / arg with initial 
state. and the 2nd arg is action. and the reducer must export as default;
    ===>
        import { ADD_TO_CART, REMOVE_FROM_CART } from "../actions/cartActions";

        const inititalState = {
            carts:[],
        }

        const cartReducers = (state=inititalState, action) => {
            switch(action.type){
                case ADD_TO_CART:
                    const newId = action.id;
                    const newCart = [...state.carts, newId];
                    return {carts:newCart};
                case REMOVE_FROM_CART:
                    const id = action.id;
                    const remainingCart = state.carts.filter(item => item !== id);
                    return {carts:remainingCart};
                default :
                    return state;
            }
        }

        export default cartReducers;

2. we can combine multiple reducers by using combineReducers method of redux.
the arg of this method is an object where has single reducer as object item. 
And the method return a combined reducer. We will export default this reducer
    ===>
        import {combineReducers} from 'reducer';

        const rootReducer = combineReducers({
            reducer1,
            reducer2,
            reducer3,
        })

        export default rootReducer;
